# IFF Master

IFF Master is a tool which lets you inspect IFF files. It's the
[EA 85 variant](https://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/EA_IFF_85_Standard_for_Interchange_Format_Files)
which is quite popular on
AmigaOS, MorphOS and AROS.

It's a partial reimplementation of [IFF Master](https://aminet.net/package/util/misc/IFFMaster16)
from Kay Drangmeister.

It's written in [GO](https://go.dev/) and uses the [Fyne](https://fyne.io/) GUI toolkit.

While it's a learning project for me it might be usefull to check the correctness
of IFF files.
